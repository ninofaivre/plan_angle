# plan_angle

It's a very simple little project. You give to the program the XY coordinate of an object in a plane (You also need to specify the width and the height of the plan)
and an angle from 0 to 360 (0 is going to the right, 90 to the top and 180 to the left). The program print the XY coordinate where the object leaves the plane.
